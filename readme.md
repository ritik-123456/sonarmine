# Sonar Data Classification Project

This project aims to classify sonar signals as either a rock ('R') or a mine ('M') based on their features. Various machine learning algorithms are explored and evaluated to determine the best performing model for this classification task.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the "sonar.all-data.csv". It contains 60 numerical features representing the sonar signal and a target variable indicating whether the object is a rock or a mine.

## Project Structure

The notebook is structured as follows:

1.  **Library Imports and Setup**: Imports necessary libraries for data handling, machine learning, and visualization. Sets up environment variables for ngrok.
2.  **Data Loading**: Loads the "sonar.all-data.csv" into a pandas DataFrame.
3.  **Data Preparation**: Splits the dataset into training and validation sets. Features are separated from the target variable.
4.  **Model Evaluation (Unscaled Data)**: Evaluates the performance of several machine learning models (Logistic Regression, LDA, KNN, CART, Naive Bayes, SVM) using cross-validation on the unscaled data.
5.  **Model Comparison (Unscaled Data)**: Visualizes the performance of the unscaled models using a box plot.
6.  **Model Evaluation (Scaled Data)**: Evaluates the performance of the same models using cross-validation on scaled data.
7.  **Model Comparison (Scaled Data)**: Visualizes the performance of the scaled models using a box plot.
8.  **Hyperparameter Tuning (KNN)**: Tunes the hyperparameters of the KNN model using GridSearchCV on scaled data.
9.  **Hyperparameter Tuning (SVM)**: Tunes the hyperparameters of the SVM model using GridSearchCV on scaled data.
10. **Ensemble Model Evaluation**: Evaluates the performance of ensemble methods (AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting, Random Forest, Extra Trees) using cross-validation.
11. **Ensemble Model Comparison**: Visualizes the performance of the ensemble models using a box plot.
12. **Final Model Evaluation**: Trains the best performing model (SVM with tuned hyperparameters) on the training data and evaluates its performance on the validation set using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.
13. **Flask Application (Incomplete/Errored)**: Attempts to create a Flask web application to serve the model and provide a prediction interface. This section contains errors and is not fully functional.
14. **Unit Tests (Errored)**: Attempts to create unit tests for the prediction functionality. This section contains errors and is not fully functional.
15. **Additional Visualizations**: Includes additional visualizations like a bar chart of mean accuracy and a confusion matrix heatmap for Logistic Regression.
